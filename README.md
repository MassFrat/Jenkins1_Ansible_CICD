# Ansible + Jenkins NGINX Integration (CI/CD)

<br/>

## Guidelines:
Automatically deploy NGINX to multiple servers
Configure NGINX with custom settings
Manage deployments through Jenkins pipelines
Ensure consistent server configurations across environments

<br/>

# Overview

<br/>

## Architecture:

<br/>

Jenkins: Orchestrates the deployment pipeline and provides CI/CD automation

Ansible: Handles configuration management and server provisioning

NGINX: Serves as the target web server for deployment

<br/>

## Workflow:

<br/>

Code changes trigger Jenkins pipeline

Jenkins executes Ansible playbooks

Ansible configures target servers and installs NGINX

NGINX serves web content with desired configurations

<br/>

# Prerequisites

<br/>

## Jenkins Requirements:

Jenkins server with administrative access

Jenkins plugins installed:

Ansible Plugin

SSH Agent Plugin (for private key management)

Pipeline Plugin (for Jenkinsfile support)

<br/>

## Ansible Requirements:

Ansible installed on Jenkins server or dedicated Ansible control node

SSH access to target servers

Python installed on target servers

<br/>

## Target Server Requirements:

SSH access configured
Sudo privileges for the deployment user
Supported OS: Ubuntu/Debian, CentOS/RHEL, or similar

<br/>

# Best Practices

<br/>

## Security:

Use Ansible Vault for sensitive data

Implement least-privilege access

Regularly rotate SSH keys


Enable SSL/TLS for web traffic

Configure security headers in NGINX

<br/>

## Performance:

Use Ansible facts caching

Implement parallel execution where possible

Optimize playbook tasks for idempotency

Monitor resource usage during deployment

<br/>

## Reliability:

<br/> 

Implement health checks at each stage

Create rollback procedures

Use blue-green deployment strategies

Maintain deployment logs and metrics

<br/>

## Maintenance:

Regularly update Ansible and Jenkins

Keep playbooks version-controlled

Document configuration changes

Test in staging before production
